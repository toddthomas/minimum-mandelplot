#  minimum-mandelplot

My attempt to find the shortest Swift Mandelbrot set plotter which is still readable and idiomatic. Inspired by [this Julia language plotter](https://julialang.org/learning/code-examples/). See [my blog post](https://toddthomas.space/2020/08/30/minimum-mandelplot.html) for a fuller discussion.
